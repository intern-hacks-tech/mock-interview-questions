# InternHacks Mock Interview Questions

A collection of questions for InternHacks mock interview questions.

When creating new questions, keep in mind:

- The challenge should be doable in a 30-minute time slot
- Leaving details ambiguous/up to interpretation can open the door to collaboration opportunities
- Focus more on assessing the intern's problem-solving skills, not their knowledge of trivia. It's more about how they approach the problem than whether they get the "right" answer.
