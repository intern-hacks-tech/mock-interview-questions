# InternHacks Mock Interview Questions

A collection of questions for InternHacks mock interview questions.

## Overview

Technical screens suck, but almost every tech job interview will involve sitting on a Zoom or phone call with someone to solve some silly problem. We have an opportunity here that is twofold: to help prepare our Interns for this reality, and also to show them how an interview SHOULD feel -- collaborative, kind, and educational.

When creating new questions, keep in mind:

- The challenge should be doable in a 30-minute time slot. If they blow through the prompt you've chosen, move on to some technical Q&A or even try to tackle another question.
- Leaving details ambiguous/up to interpretation can open the door to collaboration opportunities.
- Focus more on assessing the intern's problem-solving skills, not their knowledge of trivia. It's more about how they approach the problem than whether they get the "right" answer.
- This is our opportunity to influence the expectations the Intern has going into real job interviews in the future. That's a powerful thing. By our actions we should show that interviews should be comfortable and collaborative, and it can be a red flag for the potential job opportunity if they're not.
